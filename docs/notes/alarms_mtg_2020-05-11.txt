- LAPA - low airway pressure alarm
	50ms rolling average, end of expiratory phase
	* start low priority alarm, escalate if persists through next cycle
	* can suppress this alarm

- HAPA - high airway pressure alarm
	* HIGH alarm sounds immediately
	* 15% spike over PIP.
	* cannot suppress alarm

	- HAPA limit has to be below hardware limit. 

	- Controller will drop PIP, so has to communicate changed PIP.

- Hypoventilation, Low VTE
	* VTE (tidal volume) < low
	* priority LOW, escalate MEDIUM if exists
		escalate to med if > 15%

	* give some button to recalibrate if needed

	- hard minimum and max as well
	- 15% deviation of mean VTE

- PEEP max/min
	* MEDIUM alarm, operator fixes

- Obstruction
	* Technical alarm, HIGH priority
	* Alarm delay < 2 ccles
	* active alarm must trigger response in 1 cycle

	* drop pressure to atmospheric or PEEP
	* need to allow spontaneous breathing
	* algorithm for calculating obstruction
		- tubing kinked
		- valve
		- blocked viral/bacterial filter

	* If P_airway > PIP for 2 cycles, open EXP valve
	* if EXP valve doesn't work, cut input flow until at PEEP
	* assumption is hospital is measuring CO2 and SpO2

- disconnection/high leakage
	* technical alarm
	* MEDIUM priority
	* VTE and airway pressure low.

- oxygenation alarms
	* priority MEDIUM
	* fires for low and high.
	* +/- 5% 


UX stuff
- inadvertent high pressure
	* cannot set PIP to > 60 hPa without 2+ actions



- protection against acidental change
	* confirm settings on startup
	* must not be able to turn pvp off
	* show confirmation on start with set values.



- todo
	*** need to add unit conversion to hPa
	* reduce volume of alarm while fixing alarm.

----------------------------------

* startup
	- set stable PEEP
	- leak detection


* patient tuning routine
	- three breaths after
