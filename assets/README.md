# Content of assets
This folder contains all technical drawings for PVP1, the drawings for parts to be 3D-printed, and printed circuit boards.
In addition, to aid discoverability, we have generated a standardized Open Know How Manifest (OKH-manifest): `okh-manifest.yml`. This follows the Open Know-How Manifest Specification Version 1.0. Finally, the file `PVP1 Assembly Instructions.pdf` contains detailed step-by-step assembly instructions.
The following folders exist:

# cad
Contains a 3D-printable PEEP valve, as single-use PEEP valves can be subject to supply chain limitations. 

# DXFs
Contains drawings for laser cutting of the chassis.

# PCBS
This folder contains all of the electrical design files for our custom PCBs. 

# SOLIDWORKS
This folder contains CAD drawings of PVP1, more specifically:
1. Technical drawings of the PVP1 Mk3, in Solidworks. This is the device documented in the article, and featured in the detailed assembly instructions. This final version of PVP1 removed non-critical components, such as the humidifier and Gauges, and introduced more standardized parts.
1. The previous version of the device, Mk2, using few standardized components, and featuring a humidifier. Notice the `CPAP_BIPAP_HEATER_HUMIDIFIER_ASSY`.
1. Mk1, the first version of PVP1. This served as an early sketch about what to include in the design

# STLs
This folder contains all of our 3D printed components/fixtures that are not included in our Bill-of-Materials.
