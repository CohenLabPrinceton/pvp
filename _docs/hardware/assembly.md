**PVP1 Assembly Instructions**

This guide should help you assemble the ventilator from the parts found
in the **Bill of Materials**:

[[https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/bom.html]{.underline}](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/bom.html)

We'll first show you how to assemble the hardware, then the electronics,
and finally put the two together.

**Part 1. 3D Printed Components and Enclosure**

![](./assembly/media/image18.jpg){width="4.503898731408574in"
height="5.326726815398075in"}

**1.1 3D Printing Adapters and Brackets.**

Before we can get started with assembly, you'll need to print a few
parts using a standard 3D printer. (We ran our test prints on Prusa,
MakerBot, FlashForge, and Creality3D printers.)

**You can download all the STL files here for printing**:
[[https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/assembly.html#d-printed-parts]{.underline}](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/assembly.html#d-printed-parts)

Be sure to print airway components at as close to 100% infill as
possible, and be mindful of printing orientation. An example printing
setup is shown below. We do not recommend using supports or rafts unless
you find them to be necessary, as they are challenging to remove. If
there is a cylindrical channel, try to orient it vertically (such that
the circle is traced along the build plate), which will improve
circularity of the channel.

If you are using a Prusa i3, **we also provide this print setup here**.

**1.2 Tapping the 3D Printed Components**

Several of the 3D printed parts will need to be tapped to enable
connection with other parts in the device- such as push-to-connect
adapters. You will be able to tap all of these parts by hand (since the
plastic cuts easily), and the **Bill of Material** contains the list of
taps you will need, including specialized taps such as the M16:

[[https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/bom.html]{.underline}](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/bom.html)

All required taps are shown below:

![](./assembly/media/image132.png){width="5.755208880139983in"
height="3.394097769028871in"}

First, we will tap the Sensor Atrium component, which houses the oxygen
sensor and "emergency breathing valve" check valve, and passes air from
the inspiratory limb to the respiratory circuit (with a DAR filter in
between).

**Step 1.** Use a ¼" NPT tap to thread the hole as shown below (the
smaller airway hole on the flat side of the Sensor Atrium), where a
push-to-connect adapter will attach.

![](./assembly/media/image43.jpg){width="5.375in"
height="3.5766360454943134in"}

**Step 2.** Use the M16 tap to thread the hole on the opposite side of
the Sensor Atrium, where the oxygen sensor will attach.

![](./assembly/media/image52.jpg){width="3.0772823709536308in"
height="3.7154691601049867in"}

Next, we will tap the adapters at either side of the expiratory
solenoid.

**Step 3.** Use the ¾" NPT tap to thread the holes on the larger end of
the two "22mm to 0.75 NPTM adapter" parts.

![](./assembly/media/image49.jpg){width="2.4902744969378827in"
height="3.619792213473316in"}

Last, we will tap the adapter to the pressure sampling lines.

**Step 4.** Finally, use the ¼"-28 tap to thread the two airway holes on
the "Luer lock filter mount" part. These will hold the metal luer lock
adapters to the gas sampling lines for monitoring pressure.

**1.3 Cutting Enclosure Pieces.**

**Step 1. Laser cut, or cut out by hand, the six HPDE side panels.**

Cut all panels out of the 1/16" HPDE sheets. If you wish to cut these
pieces using a laser cutter, we provide DXF files here, under
"Enclosure":
[[https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/assembly.html]{.underline}](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/assembly.html)

Cuts can also be made by hand using a sharp pair of scissors and a
razor-cutter. Pieces are 17 ⅞" by 7 ⅞" (45.4025 cm by 20.0025 cm), or 7
⅞" by 7 ⅞" (20.0025 cm by 20.0025 cm) along the outer dimensions. Inner
hole placement can be determined from the documentation, also at:

[[https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/assembly.html]{.underline}](https://www.peoplesvent.org/en/latest/assembly.html)

(We cut our side panels for the demo out of acrylic for ease of
visibility.)

![](./assembly/media/image37.jpg){width="4.541666666666667in"
height="3.843646106736658in"}

**Step 2. Insert the rubber grommet(s).**

The bottom panel includes a hole for a large rubber grommet. Insert this
by hand.

If you wish, you may also insert a small custom grommet in the back
panel.

![](./assembly/media/image84.jpg){width="5.119792213473316in"
height="3.4131944444444446in"}

**Part 2. Basic Hardware Assembly**

**2.1 Assembling the bottom frame**

![](./assembly/media/image111.jpg){width="4.90625in"
height="3.4079975940507437in"}

**Step 1.** Cut the 80/20 ("T-slotted framing") to appropriately sized
pieces: In total, you will need 4 pieces of length 17 ⅞ in (45.4025 cm),
and 9 pieces of length 5 ⅞ in (14.9225 cm).

You can cut the aluminum 80/20 pieces by hand with a hack-saw, or using
machinery such as a bandsaw. Either way, be sure to file down any rough
edges afterward!

![](./assembly/media/image107.jpg){width="4.919071522309712in"
height="3.276042213473316in"}

**Step 2.** Attach the ¾" NPT (male-male) connectors to either side of
the expiratory solenoid, and then attach the two "22mm to .75 NPTM
adapter" parts to those, as shown. When attaching any airway threaded
parts in this assembly process, be sure to use PTFE thread sealant tape,
wrapping twice around the threads, in the direction shown (away from
your body if the threads are oriented towards the right).

(Note: From now on, we will not explicitly write out the need for Teflon
tape; be sure to use it whenever a threaded airway component is
involved!)

![](./assembly/media/image81.jpg){width="3.0052088801399823in"
height="1.9975798337707786in"}![](./assembly/media/image116.jpg){width="3.0156255468066493in"
height="2.0073884514435694in"}

![](./assembly/media/image56.jpg){width="3.0156255468066493in"
height="2.0104166666666665in"}![](./assembly/media/image41.jpg){width="2.9843755468066493in"
height="1.9895833333333333in"}

**Step 3.** Ensure that the two side ports of the pressure regulator are
blocked off, with the plugs included with the part (and Teflon tape, as
always). Attach a ¼" NPT push-to-connect adapter to the pressure
regulator on the "outlet" side: check the bottom of the part to
determine which side is "IN" for "inlet". The inlet manifold will have
two ¼" NPT ports on the same side: plug one of those with the manifold
plug, and attach the other end to the ¼" NPT connector. Attach the other
end of this connector to the "inlet" end of the pressure regulator.

![](./assembly/media/image122.jpg){width="3.0078127734033244in"
height="2.0052088801399823in"}![](./assembly/media/image36.jpg){width="3.005071084864392in"
height="2.003380358705162in"}

**Step 4.** **Mounting the inlet manifold.**

First, attach the 3D-printed "Inlet manifold bracket", by pushing two
standard button-head screws down from the top of the piece (as shown,
such that the button heads fall in the grooves), then loosely attaching
a hex nut to each. Then, slide the two hex nuts into a T-slot of a short
(5 ⅞") 80/20 piece, and use an Allen key to secure the screws such that
the printed piece is as far to the "right" as it can go (as shown),
without the hex nuts extended past the length of 80/20.

Tip: when attaching hex nuts, make sure the side with the nub is facing
down (such that it touches the inner channel of the 80/20 T-slot).

Then, insert the inlet manifold into the printed piece, as shown: if the
printed part is to the right of the 80/20 length, then the pressure
regulator should be oriented away from you. Insert the 2" button head
hex drive screws through the remaining holes in the 3D printed piece, to
secure the inlet manifold, as shown (also away from you). Finally,
attach a washer (W_10_NARROW_0.406OD_316_SS) and hex nut
(LN_10-32_STAINLESS_18-8) to each.

![](./assembly/media/image100.jpg){width="4.53286854768154in"

height="2.1006944444444446in"}

**Step 5. Attach the "Expiratory outlet bracket to PEEP".**

Drop one standard button head hex screw down the deeper channel, and
attach as before: loosely screw on a hex nut, slide it in the channel,
and then use an Allen key to tighten the screw. This time, tighten the
hex screw such that the printed part is in-line with the edge of the
80/20 piece, as shown. Then, insert a second button head hex screw,
facing outward as shown, and loosely attach a hex nut (you will tighten
this later).

![](./assembly/media/image35.jpg){width="3.151042213473316in"
height="2.1006944444444446in"}![](./assembly/media/image89.jpg){width="3.1614588801399823in"
height="2.1042169728783904in"}

**Step 6. Attach corner brackets to finish this frame piece.**

Pre-assemble the gusset (corner) brackets by inserting a hex screw into
each hole, and then loosely attaching a hex nut to each, as shown.
Tighten the gussets so that they align with the edge of the 80/20 piece,
as shown, keeping the second hex nut on each piece loose. (You will use
these to attach another 80/20 piece later.)

![](./assembly/media/image110.jpg){width="3.1991447944007in"
height="2.125883639545057in"}![](./assembly/media/image92.jpg){width="3.1718755468066493in"
height="2.1111832895888014in"}![](./assembly/media/image83.jpg){width="3.1927088801399823in"
height="2.1284722222222223in"}![](./assembly/media/image51.jpg){width="3.2031255468066493in"
height="2.138929352580927in"}

**Step 7. Attach cable tie and side panel screw.**

If you intend to use the cable P-clip for cable management, and to
attach the HPDE side panels, attach the P-clip using a standard button
head hex screw, and mount an additional hex screw for attaching the side
panel later.

![](./assembly/media/image103.jpg){width="3.2031255468066493in"
height="2.125149825021872in"}![](./assembly/media/image3.jpg){width="3.182292213473316in"
height="2.1317279090113734in"}

Progress: One piece of the bottom frame is assembled!

![](./assembly/media/image86.jpg){width="4.317708880139983in"
height="2.8784722222222223in"}

**Step 8. Assemble the opposite side of the frame.**

Assemble a second short (5 ⅞") piece of 80/20 as shown: this uses the 3D
printed part called the "Expiratory DAR filter bracket", which will
mirror the "Expiratory outlet bracket to PEEP" part on the opposing
frame leg. Also, attach three gusset (corner) brackets, as shown.

\***Note:** if you intend to attach the side panels, leave off the
corner bracket on the same side as the 3D printed piece. If you're not
using the side panels, keep the bracket here for additional support!

![](./assembly/media/image121.jpg){width="3.0546872265966756in"
height="2.0364588801399823in"}![](./assembly/media/image50.jpg){width="3.044721128608924in"
height="2.029814085739283in"}

**Step 9. Attach side panel screws.**

As before, if you plan to attach HDPE side panels later on, attach the
screws for them now, as shown.

![](./assembly/media/image69.jpg){width="3.1578904199475066in"
height="2.1052602799650044in"}![](./assembly/media/image24.jpg){width="3.1718755468066493in"
height="2.1179943132108487in"}

**Step 10. Attach the expiratory solenoid assembly to the frame.**

-   First, assemble and attach two gusset (corner) brackets to their hex
    > screws/nuts, then affix to a long (17 ⅞") leg of the framing,
    > leaving 1" from the end of the piece on each side (that is,
    > leaving space for a vertical piece of 80/20).

-   Then, attach three hex screws/nuts to the lower rows of each
    > 90-degree angle bracket as shown; then attach the angle brackets
    > by inserting a short (1mm long) button head screw through the
    > topmost hole of each angle bracket in the opposite direction.
    > These shorter hex screws will screw directly into the solenoid.

-   Finally, slide the hex nuts attached to the angle brackets into the
    > T-slot of the 80/20 piece, such that the gusset brackets and
    > solenoid are oriented above the 80/20 piece, as shown. Loosely
    > tighten these in place; you will adjust the position of the
    > solenoid later.

![](./assembly/media/image67.jpg){width="4.494792213473316in"
height="2.9995483377077865in"}

![](./assembly/media/image80.jpg){width="3.1640627734033244in"
height="2.1093755468066493in"}![](./assembly/media/image23.jpg){width="3.1540955818022747in"
height="2.1027307524059493in"}![](./assembly/media/image44.jpg){width="3.1540955818022747in"

height="2.1302088801399823in"}

**Step 11. Attach gusset (corner) brackets to the opposing 80/20 leg.**

Assemble the gusset (corner) brackets with hex screw/nuts as before, and
attach them to a long (17 ⅞") 80/20 piece. Leave 1" of space from each
of the side gussets (sufficient space for a vertical 80/20 piece), and
affix the third bracket just off-center (to support a centered, vertical
80/20 piece).

![](./assembly/media/image20.jpg){width="3.1640627734033244in"
height="2.1093755468066493in"}![](./assembly/media/image2.jpg){width="3.1718755468066493in"
height="2.1145833333333335in"}

**Step 12. Assemble the bottom frame components.**

Slide the hex nuts on the shorter 80/20 pieces you have assembled into
the longer 80/20 slots, and use an Allen key to tighten the screws in
place, as shown. The shorter 80/20 legs should be flush with the ends of
the longer 80/20 legs when you are done, and the gusset (corner)
brackets will help stabilize the frame.

![](./assembly/media/image123.jpg){width="3.0859372265966756in"
height="2.057292213473316in"}![](./assembly/media/image112.jpg){width="3.088542213473316in"
height="2.0590277777777777in"}

**Step 13. Attaching the ventilator "feet" and bottom panel.**

If you are attaching the lower, perforated HPDE sheet, insert the rubber
grommet. Pre-assemble the shorter (1mm) button head screws to hex nuts,
and the leveling mounts (feet) to hex nuts. Use these to attach the
lower HPDE panel as shown, by sliding the hex nuts along the long
channels on the bottom of the frame assembly; then tighten in place.

![](./assembly/media/image126.jpg){width="3.1614588801399823in"
height="2.1178696412948383in"}![](./assembly/media/image14.jpg){width="3.21123031496063in"
height="2.1339807524059493in"}![](./assembly/media/image76.jpg){width="3.190167322834646in"

height="2.123564085739283in"}

**Step 14. Attach the respiratory tube segment.**

Awesome- almost done with the lower level of the ventilator! As a last
step, attach the short segment of respiratory circuit between the
"Expiratory outlet bracket to PEEP" and the nearest "22mm to .75NPTM
adapter". You'll be able to twist this on by hand.

![](./assembly/media/image59.jpg){width="5.208333333333333in"
height="3.0625in"}

**2.2 Assembling the frame sides**

![](./assembly/media/image30.jpg){width="5.466862423447069in"
height="3.626093613298338in"}

**Step 1. Attach the proportional valve to its mount.**

Use the two socket head screws (6mm long) to attach the proportional
valve to the 3D printed "proportional valve bracket". The inlet should
be to the right in the orientation shown below.

![](./assembly/media/image21.jpg){width="3.6875in"
height="2.4615255905511813in"}![](./assembly/media/image32.jpg){width="3.151042213473316in"

height="2.106502624671916in"}

**Step 2. Attach the pressure relief valve to its adapters.**

Assemble the T-line push-to-connect adapter, to a female-female ¼" NPT
connector, and finally to the Nylon pressure release valve.

![](./assembly/media/image91.jpg){width="3.1614588801399823in"
height="2.118176946631671in"}![](./assembly/media/image6.jpg){width="3.1718755468066493in"
height="2.1179286964129482in"}

**Step 3. Attach the luer lock connectors to the luer lock filter
mount.**

These pieces will screw in, with the luer lock portions facing outwards.

![](./assembly/media/image77.jpg){width="3.1636734470691166in"
height="2.109115266841645in"}![](./assembly/media/image98.jpg){width="3.1794127296587926in"
height="2.109115266841645in"}

**Step 4. Assemble the sensor atrium.**

Attach the ¼" NPT push-to-connect adapter, check valve, and oxygen
sensor into the appropriate holes in the "Sensor Atrium Manifold", as
shown. Do not push the check valve into the device too far, as it may
restrict air flow within the atrium.

![](./assembly/media/image54.jpg){width="3.1853455818022747in"
height="2.123564085739283in"}![](./assembly/media/image102.jpg){width="3.182292213473316in"
height="2.1249496937882766in"}![](./assembly/media/image45.jpg){width="3.182292213473316in"

height="2.1284470691163606in"}

**Step 5. Attach sensor atrium to a short 80/20, and then to the
device.**

Affix button head screws/nuts to the sensor atrium, with hex nuts facing
towards one another, as shown. Slide the hex nuts along T-slots on
either side of a short (5 ⅞") 80/20 piece; then insert this vertically
into the device as shown. Tighten into place via the hex screws on the
lower gusset (corner) brackets.\
**\*Note:** If you are attaching the side panels, be sure to use a SHORT
nut on the sensor atrium (the nut on the side with two, farther from the
oxygen sensor), and keep the short side facing down when inserting. This
will allow the sensor atrium to drop lower and align with the holes in
the front panel.

![](./assembly/media/image113.jpg){width="3.184682852143482in"
height="2.1197090988626424in"}![](./assembly/media/image64.jpg){width="3.1302088801399823in"

height="2.1092924321959754in"}

**Step 6. Attach the second vertical leg, along the "Expiratory DAR
filter bracket".**

As before, slide a short (5 ⅞") 80/20 piece into the position shown,
then tighten the hex screws.

![](./assembly/media/image61.jpg){width="4.723958880139983in"
height="3.1493055555555554in"}

**Step 7. Attach the luer lock filter bracket to the newly inserted
80/20 leg.\
\*Note:** If you're attaching the side panels, use another SHORT 80/20
nut in the uppermost spot on the bracket. We'll want this part to be as
high as possible to match up with the holes on the front panel.

![](./assembly/media/image33.jpg){width="4.828125546806649in"
height="3.211930227471566in"}

**Step 8. Attach the third vertical 80/20 leg, then attach the
proportional valve mount.**

Insert a third, short (5 ⅞") 80/20 piece, then tighten the hex screw to
hold it in place. Use another standard hex screw/nut to attach the
proportional valve mount to this piece, towards the inside of the
device, such that the push-to-connects roughly align vertically with the
push-to-connect on the sensor atrium.

![](./assembly/media/image114.jpg){width="3.118163823272091in"

height="2.0857206911636044in"}

**Step 9. Attach the final two vertical 80/20 pieces in the remaining
corners.**

**\*Note:** If you're attaching the side panels, now is the time to
insert 80/20 nuts on the vertical 80/20 pieces as well as the long 80/20

**Step 10.** **Attach the D-Lite.**

Attach a blue silicone connector to the "Expiratory DAR filter bracket),
on the side within the device. Then, insert the D-Lite between the
silicone connector and the nearest "22mm to .75 NPTM adapter", adjusting
the position of the expiratory solenoid assembly until the D-lite is
firmly connected at each end. The smaller end of the D-lite should fit
within the "22mm to .75 NPTM adapter". Then, use an Allen key to tighten
the hex screws on the 90 degree angle brackets to maintain the position
of the solenoid.

**Step 11. Attach the pressure release valve and pneumatic tubing.**

Cut the pneumatic tubing into three segments: two of length 2.5"
(6.35cm), and one of length 5.5" (13.97cm). Insert the long piece
between the push-to-connect adapters attached to the pressure regulator
and proportional valve. Insert the two shorter tubes into either
push-to-connect on the pressure relief valve assembly; then attach these
between the sensor atrium and proportional valve push-to-connects, as
shown. These tubing lengths should keep the proportional valve fairly
centered.

height="2.9618055555555554in"}

**Step 4. Cut and punch DIN rail pieces.**

Cut the DIN rail to 7 ⅞" (20.0025cm) lengths, punching or drilling holes
½" (1.27cm) from each edge large enough to support the standard button
head hex screws.

![](./assembly/media/image26.jpg){width="4.109375546806649in"
height="2.735135608048994in"}

**Step 5. Attach the DIN rails and assemble the rest of the top level.**

-   Slide two long (17 ⅞") 80/20 pieces onto one of the shorter pieces,
    > and screw in place. Add an additional gusset (corner) bracket to
    > each long leg, as shown, leaving 1" of space from the end (to
    > support a vertical piece).

-   Use a short (1mm) button head hex screw, a zinc washer
    > (W_0.25_FLAT_THICK_GR8_YELLOW_ZINC), and a standard hex nut to
    > attach each end of the DIN rails to the frame, as shown. Slide an
    > additional gusset (corner) bracket between the rails on one side-
    > this will support the central vertical channel on the device.

-   Once the DIN rails are roughly in place (exact positions can be
    > adjusted later), use the remaining gusset (corner) brackets and
    > assembled short 80/20 piece, and mirror the other side of the
    > assembly, as shown.

height="3.745117016622922in"}

You will also need:

-   A soldering iron

-   Solder

-   Helping hands for holding parts while soldering

-   Wire cutters (for clipping off long capacitor/resistor legs)

**Step 1. Solder the 40-pin stackable RPi header to the Actuator PCB.**

Push the pins up from the bottom of the board, as shown, and then solder
into place.

![](./assembly/media/image8.jpg){width="4.421012685914261in"
height="2.947341426071741in"}![](./assembly/media/image73.jpg){width="4.416666666666667in"

**Step 2. Solder the 4-pin, 3-pin, and 2-pin 0.1" headers onto the board
(positions J2, J3, J4).**

Break the pins off the larger header array in units of 4, 2, and 3 using
pliers. Insert the short end of the pins into the holes from the top of
the board, and solder from below. This will leave the long ends of the
pins sticking up vertically from the board, as shown:

![](./assembly/media/image88.jpg){width="4.020833333333333in"
height="3.277742782152231in"}

**Step 3. Solder the 330 Ohm resistor onto the board (position R1).**

Bend the resistor legs before inserting into the board from above.
Ideally, solder the resistor in place such that the resistor is hovering
just above the board. Then, snip the long legs off from the back of the
board (cutting above the tiny "cone" formed by the solder) using wire
cutters.

![](./assembly/media/image96.jpg){width="3.9583333333333335in"

oxygen sensor) onto the board (position U2).**

As before, make sure that the notch on the part aligns with the notch
drawn on the PCB.

![](./assembly/media/image62.jpg){width="4.140625546806649in"
height="3.504382108486439in"}

**Step 7. Solder the Amphenol 5 INCH-D2-P4V-MINI (differential pressure
sensor) onto the board (position U3).**

Bend all four pins evenly and orient the part such that the black ports
face towards the outside of the board. The pressure lines will attach
here.

![](./assembly/media/image93.jpg){width="4.125in"
height="3.4694378827646544in"}

**Step 8. Solder the Adafruit ADS1115 (12-bit ADC) to the board.**

First, solder the pins to the ADC itself, with the long ends facing
down. Then insert the pins through the board and solder from the back
side.

![](./assembly/media/image7.jpg){width="4.911458880139983in"

**Step 2. Solder the 2-pin 0.1" header onto the board (position J5).**

Insert the short end of the pins into the holes from the top of the
board, and solder from below. This will leave the long ends of the pins
sticking up vertically from the board, as shown:

![](./assembly/media/image133.png){width="5.242187226596675in"
height="3.494792213473316in"}

**Step 3. Solder the 100 µF, 16V capacitor onto the board (position
C1).**

Insert the legs of the capacitor into the slots from the top of the
board. The longer leg should be inserted into the side marked "+". Once
the capacitor is soldered in place, use wire cutters to clip off the
long legs from the back.

![](./assembly/media/image128.png){width="5.177083333333333in"

height="3.0596587926509184in"}

**Step 1. Attach three gas sampling lines to the port on the two
pressure sensors.**

The differential pressure sensor has two ports. If you have an
airway-safe glue, feel free to glue these in place (not required).

![](./assembly/media/image60.jpg){width="4.25in"
height="2.8301356080489937in"}

**Step 2. Begin stacking the board by attaching the DIN rail mounts.**

You can pre-"tap" the 3D printed DIN rail mounts using the small screws
that come with the Raspberry Pi. Then, screw four of the 16mm standoffs
through the Raspberry Pi from above, and into the DIN rail mounts, as
shown.

![](./assembly/media/image82.jpg){width="3.1718755468066493in"

height="2.1109733158355204in"}

**Step 3. Next, add the sensor board.**

Connect the sensor board via the stackable headers, then use another
four 16mm standoffs to attach the board by screwing these into the
original four standoffs, using pliers as needed.

![](./assembly/media/image42.jpg){width="3.1305785214348205in"

**Part 4. Putting it all together**

**4.1 Wrapping it up.**

![](./assembly/media/image12.jpg){width="5.203125546806649in"
height="3.46875in"}

**(Optional step:** Attach the side panels using the shorter 80/20 hex
screws, as you go.)

**Step 1. Attach the DAR filters.**

Insert these by hand to the appropriate ports on the front of the
device, as shown: these will attach to the sensor atrium and the
expiratory DAR filter bracket. The DAR filters indicate which end should
face the patient.

![](./assembly/media/image11.jpg){width="4.15625in"
height="2.7581517935258093in"}

**Step 2. Attach the luer lock filter.**

This can be twisted on by hand to the luer lock adapter at the front of
the device.

![](./assembly/media/image34.jpg){width="5.244792213473316in"
height="3.4965277777777777in"}

**Step 3. Attach the PEEP valve.**

If you're using a commercial PEEP valve, begin by attaching the blue
silicone connector. Then, insert the PEEP valve into the 3D printed
"22mm to commercial PEEP adapter"- then plug this assembly into the
silicone connector.

![](./assembly/media/image120.jpg){width="3.1328718285214348in"

height="2.0937839020122486in"}

**Step 4. Attach the power supply.**

Pull the tab on the Meanwell power supply to attach it to the DIN rail
closest to the back of the device. It may be necessary to adjust the
position of this DIN rail to ensure that the power supply is not
touching the expiratory solenoid or inlet manifold/pressure regulator.
Feel free to reposition as needed!

**\*Note:** if you wish to attach a rear HPDE panel, we recommend
inserting the power cable to the power supply through the grommet of the
rear panel before insertion of the power supply into the device. Do this
now! You can also attach the "Rear Panel Vent"s to the rear panel; they
will snap right in.

![](./assembly/media/image31.jpg){width="3.0595833333333333in"

height="2.048581583552056in"}

**Step 5. Attach the luer lock plug to the D-Lite.**

The third port on the D-Lite (physically removed from the other two) is
not needed; plug that now with a luer lock plug.

![](./assembly/media/image16.jpg){width="4.851562773403325in"
height="3.2343755468066493in"}

**Step 6. Attach the power and ground wires to the PCB stack. Then wire
the proportional valve and solenoid.**

Use a small flathead screwdriver to attach the power and ground from the
power supply to the PCB stack where indicated. Then do the same for the
proportional valve wires and the expiratory solenoid wires: the board
indicates which pair goes where!

![](./assembly/media/image87.jpg){width="3.182292213473316in"

height="2.1283125546806647in"}

**Step 7. Attach the gas sampling lines to the D-Lite.**

Use the luer lock connector on the smaller of the two ports, then
connect the two gas sampling lines from the differential pressure sensor
(from the same sensor on the Sensor Board).

![](./assembly/media/image10.jpg){width="4.356253280839895in"
height="2.9116349518810147in"}

**Step 8. Attach the gas sampling line to the luer lock filter mount
adapter.**

The third gas sampling line runs from the second pressure sensor; attach
this to the inner luer lock adapter on the luer lock filter mount.

![](./assembly/media/image104.jpg){width="4.234375546806649in"
