    PVP block diagram for main electrical components

The PVP is coordinated by a Raspberry Pi 4 board, which runs the graphical user interface, administers the alarm system, monitors sensor values, and sends actuation commands to the valves.
The core electrical system consists of two modular PCB 'hats', a sensor PCB and an actuator PCB, that stack onto the Raspberry Pi via 40-pin stackable headers.
The modularity of this system enables individual boards to be revised or modified to adapt to component substitutions if required.

We outsourced our PCB fabrication to Advanced Circuits, based out of Aurora, CO (for $33 each): https://www.4pcb.com/pcb-prototype-2-4-layer-boards-specials.html
If you would like to do the same, you can send them the Gerber .zip files we have provided directly.

Power and I/O
----------------
The main power to the systems is supplied by a DIN rail-mounted 150W 24V supply, which drives the inspiratory valve (4W) and expiratory valves (13W). This voltage is converted to 5V by a switched mode PCB-mounted regulated to power the Raspberry Pi and sensors.
This power is transmitted across the PCBs through the stacked headers when required.

Sensor PCB
----------------
The sensor board interfaces four analog output sensors with the Raspberry Pi via I2C commands to a 12-bit 4-channel ADC (Adafruit ADS1015).

1. an airway pressure sensor (Amphenol 1 PSI-D-4V-MINI)
2. a differential pressure sensor (Amphenol 5 INCH-D2-P4V-MINI) to report the expiratory flow rate through a D-Lite spirometer
3. an oxygen sensor (Sensiron SS-12A) whose 13 mV differential output signal is amplified 250-fold by an instrumentation amplifier (Texas Instruments INA126)
4. a fourth auxiliary slot for an additional analog output sensor (unused)

A set of additional header pins allows for digital output sensors (such as the Sensiron SFM3300 flow sensor) to be interfaced with the Pi directly via I2C if desired.

Actuator PCB
----------------
The purpose of the actuator board is twofold:

1. regulate the 24V power supply to 5V (CUI Inc PDQE15-Q24-S5-D DC-DC converter)
2. interface the Raspberry Pi with the inspiratory and expiratory valves through an array of solenoid drivers (ULN2003A Darlington transistor array)
