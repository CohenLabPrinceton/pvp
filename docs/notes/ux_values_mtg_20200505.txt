<--- todo --->
* go through parameters and wat they mean
	* defaults?
	* display actual values or just measured values?
	* ie ratio is what now? what is reverse option?
		* how set IE? t-insp, t-exp?
	* which have alarms?
* when to trigger alarms

<--- questions --->
* should have prototype waveform display?
	- yes. display piecewise linear function and underlay recent history of traces
* can autostart when all necessary params set?
	- no, should have 'on' button
* how turn off?
	- u dont

<--- decisions --->
* don't set default values for controls,
	* prompt user with wizard
* stick with integers when possible
	* mind precision in fda docs
* toggle autoset limits as proportion of related control value
* display measured values next to control value
* dropdown box selecting which two t_insp settings you want (t_insp, rr, i:e)
* i:e needs to always be displayed
	* display all three, toggle which is fixed with radio box. 
* prompt to set FiO2 on start (manually)
* mode field: pressure control

<--- plots --->
checkbox to enable

* ideal vs measured waveform
	with longform pressure timeseries underlaid?
* volume vs time
* flow vs time
