Software Overview
==================

PVP is modularly designed to facilitate future adaptation to new hardware configurations and ventilation modes. APIs were designed for each of the modules to a) make them easily inspected and configured and b) make it clear to future developers how to adapt the system to their needs. 

PVP runs as multiple independent processes The GUI provides an interface to control and monitor ventilation, and the controller process handles the ventilation logic and interfaces with the hardware. Inter-process communication is mediated by a coordinator module via xml-rpc. Several ’common’ modules facilitate system configuration and constitute the inter-process API. We designed  the API around a uni-fied, configurablevaluesmodule that allow the GUI andcontroller to be reconfigured while also ensuring system robustness and simplicity.

* The :ref:`GUI <gui_overview>` and :ref:`Coordinator <coordinator_overview>` run in the first process, receive user input, display system status, and relay :class:`~.message.ControlSetting` s to the :ref:`Controller <controller_overview>` .
* At launch, the :ref:`Coordinator <coordinator_overview>` spawns a :ref:`Controller <controller_overview>` that runs the logic of the ventilator based on control values from the GUI.
* The :ref:`Controller <controller_overview>` communicates with a third `pigpiod <http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/>`_ process which communicates with the ventilation hardware

PVP is configured by

* The :ref:`Values <values_overview>` module parameterizes the different sensor and control values displayed by the GUI and used by the controller
* The :ref:`Prefs <prefs_overview>` module creates a ``prefs.json`` file in ``~/pvp`` that defines user-specific preferences.

PVP is launched like::

    python3 -m pvp.main

And launch options can be displayed with the ``--help`` flag.

Folder Structure
==================

The repository is organized as follows:

* `pvp/assets/` contains technical information like CAD drawings, circuit diagrams.
* `pvp/data/`   contains information for calibrating sensors;  data and information.
* `pvp/_docs` and pvp/docs is raw, and built documentation.
* `pvp/tests` contains automated tests for all software modules.
* `pvp/sandbox` is experimental code, that is not necessary to operate pvp. Place your toy programs here.
* `pvp/pvp` is the main code. It contains individual files for all modules of PVP1. Binary files like audio/graphics are deposited with the respective module, and not collected in a central site.
