Contains a 3D-printable PEEP valve, as single-use PEEP valves can be subject to supply chain limitations. 

# DXFs
Contains drawings for laser cutting of the chassis.

# PCBS
This folder contains all of the electrical design files for our custom PCBs. 

# SOLIDWORKS
This folder contains our CAD assembly with nearly all parts modeled and assembled. 
1. Technical drawings of the PVP1 Mk3, in Solidworks. This is the device documented in the article, and featured in the detailed assembly instructions.
1. The final version of PVP1, removing non-critcal components, such as the humidifier and Gauges, and introducing more standardized parts.
1. The next version of the device, Mk2, using more standardized components, and featuring a humidifier. Notice the CPAP_BIPAP_HEATER_HUMIDIFIER_ASSY
1. The first Mk 1 version of the device. This was the first iteration of a ventilator and served as an early sketch about what to include in the design
1. Detailed assembly instructions.

Simplified, got rid of humidifier.

# STLs
