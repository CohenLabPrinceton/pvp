title: The People’s Ventilator Project (PVP)
description: The People’s Ventilator Project (PVP) is an open-source, low-cost
  pressure-control ventilator designed for minimal reliance on specialized
  medical parts to better adapt to supply chain shortages. The PVP largely
  follows established design conventions, most importantly active and
  computer-controlled inhalation, together with passive exhalation. PVP is a
  pressure-controlled ventilator that uses a minimal set of inexpensive,
  off-the-self hardware components. An inexpensive proportional valve controls
  inspiratory flow, and a relay valve controls expiratory flow. A gauge pressure
  sensor monitors airway pressure, and an inexpensive D-lite spirometer used in
  conjunction with a differential pressure sensor monitors expiratory flow.
  PVP’s components are coordinated by a Raspberry Pi 4 board, which runs the
  graphical user interface, administers the alarm system, monitors sensor
  values, and sends actuation commands to the valves. The core electrical system
  consists of two modular board ‘hats’, a sensor board and an actuator board,
  that stack onto the Raspberry Pi via 40-pin stackable headers. The modularity
  of this system enables individual boards to be revised or modified to
  substitute components in the case of part scarcity.
intended-use: >
  PVP1 supports pressure-controlled ventilation, combined with standard-features
  like autonomous breath detection, and the suite of FDA required alarms.
