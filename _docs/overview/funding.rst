We wish to thank the Trevor Day School of NYC (https://www.trevor.org) for their kind loan of multiple 3D printers, which greatly contributed to the rapid prototyping efforts of the team. Additional thanks are in order to recognize the indeterminate length of the loan (...no really, thanks for not asking for them back yet). 

We also wish to thank Nick and Alex Winnard of the Berkshire Laser Co. in Pittsfield, MA (https://berkshirelaserco.com/) for generously donating their laser cutting and engraving services. We are grateful for their skills and expertise in creating the gorgeous acrylic enclosure, as displayed on our prototype device, and guidance improving the enclosure documentation.
