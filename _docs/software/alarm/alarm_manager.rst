Alarm Manager
================

The alarm manager is responsible for checking the :class:`.Alarm_Rule` s and maintaining
the :class:`.Alarm` s active in the system.

Only one instance of the :class:`.Alarm_Manager` can be created at once, and if it is
instantiated again, the existing object will be returned.
